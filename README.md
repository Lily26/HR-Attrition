# HR-Attrition
Prediction of Attrition in an Organisation using HR data-Machine Learning
This is a project on Prediction of Attrition of Employees in an organisation using HR Data Set(Attrition Case Study.xlsx). The data set comprises of both Categorical and Continuous Variables. The intention of is to predict the Attrition column with labels-0 and 1 where 0 means Employee is still with the company and 1 means Employee has already left the organisation.
Following Procedures have been performed on the data:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Prepare data for Analysis, Treat Missing Data, Wrong Data, Outlier Data, Feature Generation 
EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis): Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis 
Sampling- Created Training and testing samples-80/20
Standardisation- of Data using StandardScalar/LabelEncoding
Encoding categorical variables- using One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding
Creating Regression models- Linear Regression,KNN, Decision tree Regressor and ensemble techniques such as Random Forest Regressor and AdaBoost Regressor for prediction of Employee "MonthlyRate".
Creating Classification models- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,KNN, Decision tree Classifier and ensemble techniques such as Random Forest Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier for prediction of Employee "Attrition".
Finally, unsupervised learning has been performed using KMeans to identify clusters of employees to find similarities/patterns and further understand the data.
